# [AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (AIMET)](https://github.com/quic/aimet)
> AIMET is a library that provides advanced model quantization and compression techniques for trained neural network models. It provides features that have been proven to improve run-time performance of deep learning neural network models with lower compute and memory requirements and minimal impact to task accuracy.

# concept
### open-loop and close-loop
open-loop: 从输入到输出是一连串的，按照设定好的顺序执行，没有反馈。例如空调遥控、洗衣机、马路信号灯
